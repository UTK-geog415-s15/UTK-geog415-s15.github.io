<h3 id="find-git">Find Git</h3>

<p>RStudio can only act as a GUI front-end for Git if <a href="git01_git-install.html">Git has been successfully installed</a> AND RStudio can find it.</p>

<p>A basic test for successful installation of Git is to simply enter <code>git</code> in the shell.  You can easily open a shell window from R at <em>Tools &gt; Shell…</em>. If you get a complaint about Git not being found, it means installation was unsuccessful or that it is not being found, i.e. it is not on your <code>PATH</code>.</p>

<p>If you are not sure where the Git executable lives, try this in a shell:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>which git</code> (Mac, Linux)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>where git</code> (most versions of Windows)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>whereis git.exe</code> (some other versions of Windows)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If Git appears to be installed and findable, launch RStudio. Quit and re-launch RStudio if there’s <strong>any doubt in your mind</strong> about whether you opened RStudio before or after installing Git.</p>

<p>From RStudio, go to <em>Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Git</em> and make sure that the box <em>Git executable</em> points to … the Git executable. It should read something like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>/usr/bin/git</code> (Mac, Linux)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I actually had a newer version of git at <code>/usr/local/git/bin/git</code> (Mac)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>C:/Program Files (x86)/Git/bin/git.exe</code> (Windows)</p>

    <p>Here is a <a href="http://www.molecularecologist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screenshot-2013-11-12-09.53.56-Copy1.png">screenshot</a> of someone doing this on a Windows machine.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>WARNING</strong>: On Windows, do <strong>NOT</strong> use <code>C:/Program Files (x86)/Git/cmd/git.exe</code>. The difference between the good and bad paths is <code>bin</code> vs. <code>cmd</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Restart</strong> RStudio if you made any changes. DO IT.</p>

<h3 id="test-the-communication-between-rstudio-and-git">Test the communication between RStudio and Git</h3>

<p>We will create a new dummy “Project” and direct RStudio to put it under version control</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do <code>File &gt; New Project...</code>. You should see a pop up <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/images/screenshots/rstudio-projects_new.png">like this</a>.</li>
  <li>Select “New Directory: Start a project in a brand new working directory”.</li>
  <li>Select “Empty Project: Create a new project in an empty directory”.</li>
  <li>Create a new directory for this project anywhere you wish, perhaps with a name like <code>test</code>. You can delete this very soon.</li>
  <li>If you see a checkbox “Create a git repository”, that is a very good sign! Check it. <strong>If you do not see this checkbox, Git was not successfully installed or RStudio cannot find Git. Restart RStudio, if that doesn’t work, return to the previous section and, perhaps, reinstall Git using a different method that leaves Git in a conventional location.</strong></li>
  <li>After RStudio opens your test Project, the upper right pane should have a “Git” tab, typically along with “Environment”, “History”, etc. You can see an example <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/images/screenshots/rstudio-vcs.png">in this screenshot</a>.</li>
  <li>If this has gone well, it looks like Git and RStudio are ready to work together! Feel free to quit RStudio and delete the <code>test</code> directory/Project.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this has not gone well, here is another thing to try:</p>

<ul>
  <li>With your Project open, go to <code>Tools &gt; Project Options...</code>. If available, click on “Git/SVN” and select “Git” in the Version control system dropdown menu. Answer “yes” to the “Confirm New Git Repository” pop up. Answer “yes” to the “Confirm Restart RStudio” pop up.</li>
</ul>
