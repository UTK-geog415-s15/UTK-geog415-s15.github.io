## Find your sherpas

#### Instructor

Nicholas Nagle, Assistant Professor

Office: BGB 307

Office Hours: Thursday 1:30-3:30 or by appointment

Phone: 865-974-6035

This semester I am only on campus Monday afteroon, and all day on Tuesday and Thursday.  During these times, I have a pretty open policy regarding drop-ins.  Just knock if the door is closed... a closed door doesn't mean I don't want visitors.  It just means I don't want distractions from the hall.  At other times, I will likely be off-campus at Oak Ridge National Lab.

## Find the basecamp

#### Lecture

Location: BGB 101

Time: Tu/Th 11:10-12:25

#### Lab

Location: BGB 202

Time: Monday 1:25-3:20 OR 3:35-5:30

## Gear to bring

#### Textbooks

**Required** Peter Rogerson, *Statistical Methods for Geographers*.  Sage Press. 2010.

Peter Rogerson is great, and the text is good too, but that doesn't mean I don't want to supplement it.  Additional readings will be assigned in class as needed.  

#### Required Computer Equipment

You will need to bring to lab either:

- Your own personal laptop computer (and power cord).
- Or a USB “thumb” drive. I recommend a 4GB or larger USB drive.

I strongly strongly strongly recommend that your bring your own laptop to lab.  This will give you the most control over your software and help to ease the transition between the classroom and home.

## The Destination

#### Course Overview
This course is about data analysis in geography.  We will learn about how models and data are used to learn about our world.

#### Learning Outcomes

- Students will understand the concepts of location and variability, and be able to choose appropriate graphics to communicate these.
- Students will be able to characterize hypothesis testing and how they are used in scientific investigations.
- Students will be able to describe the difference between correlation and regression, how to explain regression output, and be able to identify its limitations in specific applications.
- Students will be able to explain the complications to statistical analysis that are encountered by geographers.

#### How you can make sure you arrive safely
Of course, there is the obvious: come to class prepared, having completed the reading for that segment and completed lab assigments.  Beyond that, the most important element of of student success in quantitative methods is take control and to constantly self-assess your understanding by asking "Why is this material important?  The professor obviously thinks this is important, why is that?"  If, at any point, for any topic, you are unable to answer this question, then you need to ask questions in class until you understand.

#### Methods of Instruction
This course has lecture and computer lab components.  The lecture component will occasionally include question and answering, discussion, and individual and group problem solving.  The computer lab will introduce students to the R statistical software and allow students to explore techniques.  Lab exercises will often be discussed in lecture.


## Grade Distribution

#### Undergraduates

- Lab assignments/Homework: 50%  Homework will be assigned during the lab sections.  Homework assignments are usually due one week after being assigned, however, some may have extended due dates.
- Midterm exam:  25%
- Final exam: 25%

#### Graduates

 - Lab assigments/homework: 30%
 - Midterm: 20%
 - Final Exam: 20%
 - Final Project: 30%



## Participation and Attendance

Participation means *participation*, not simply being present.

This class goes a lot more smoothly when students take some control of it, by asking questions about the material and about other quantitative work they have seen elsewhere.  

I will not grade attendance.  I believe that it is a prerequisite of an acceptable grade.  If you fail to show up for class, I will likely\ *impute* that to a lack of concern about your grade, and I will be less likely to give you the benefit of the doubt should you need it.

## Trail Rules

#### No extra credit  

As a policy of the Geography Department, extra work for credit is not allowed.

#### Campus Civility Statement

Civility is genuine respect and regard for others: politeness, consideration, tact, good manners, graciousness, cordiality, affability, amiability and courteousness. Civility enhances academic freedom and integrity, and is a prerequisite to the free exchange of ideas and knowledge in the learning community. Our community consists of students, faculty, staff, alumni, and campus visitors. Community members affect each other’s well-being and have a shared interest in creating and sustaining an environment where all community members and their points of view are valued and respected. Affirming the value of each member of the university community, the campus asks that all its members adhere to the principles of civility and community adopted by the campus: http://civility.utk.edu/.

#### Academic Integrity

“An essential feature of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville is a commitment to maintaining an atmosphere of intellectual integrity and academic honesty. As a student of the university, I pledge that I will neither knowingly give nor receive any inappropriate assistance in academic work, thus affirming my own personal commitment to honor and integrity.”

Students are responsible for the information in [Hilltopics] (http://dos.utk.edu/hilltopics/) regarding the policies and procedures about plagiarism and other forms of student misconduct.

#### Disabilities that Constrain Learning

“Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS) at 865-974-6087 in 2227 Dunford Hall to document their eligibility for services. ODS will work with students and faculty to coordinate reasonable accommodations for students with documented disabilities.”

#### YOUR ROLE IN IMPROVING TEACHING AND LEARNING THROUGH COURSE ASSESSMENT

At UT, it is our collective responsibility to improve the state of teaching and learning. During the semester, you may be requested to assess aspects of this course either during class or at the completion of the class. You are encouraged to respond to these various forms of assessment as a means of continuing to improve the quality of the UT learning experience.
