## Download the software
 - [R Project](http://www.r-project.com) It all begins with getting the software.
 - [R Studio](http://www.rstudio.com) The most friendly and flexible way to use R.


## General Learning Resources
 - Need help?  Ask a programming question at [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) (begin searches with the tag [R]) or a stats question at [Cross Validated](http://stats.stackexchange.com).  But chances are, someone has already asked for you!
 - Of course, someone already asked about [Resources for learning R](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/138/resources-for-learning-r).
 - [Short R Intro](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf) Short and pretty thorough.  I like it.
 - [Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com)
 - [R Studio](http://www.rstudio.com/resources/training/online-learning/#R)
 - [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/index.html)
 - [Impatient R](http://www.burns-stat.com/documents/tutorials/impatient-r/).  Even translated into French and Serbo-Croatian! Superbe!  Izvanredan!
 - [Read R bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com) I have all posts sent to my news feed.
 - [UCLA Institute for Digital Research and Education](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/)
